# Dzidzi App
A mobile application that displays local foods and their recipes. 
The application consists of a home page where breakfast, lunch, and supper image cards as well as their labels are shown. These cards route
you to the respective pages, breakfast, lunch, and supper pages. The app also consists of a bottom navigation bar which can lead to a home 
fragment, a search fragment, and a feedback fragment. The application also consists of an SQLite database that supplies data to every page.
Team members were assigned pages to implement.
